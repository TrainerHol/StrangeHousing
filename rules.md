# 📜 Rules

This list is not exhaustive, and administrators may address situations as they deem necessary to maintain a positive environment.

## 🤝 Be respectful

We encourage a friendly atmosphere. To maintain harmony, we suggest avoiding potentially divisive topics such as religion, politics, vaccines, and social issues. Our focus is on enjoying jump puzzles together.

## 👥 Be mindful of your audience

Our community includes jump puzzle enthusiasts of all skill levels and backgrounds. We encourage celebrating achievements without diminishing others' experiences. If you're seeking additional challenges, consider exploring our extensive list of over 500 jump puzzles.

## 🙈 Be cautious with spoilers

Many members may not have completed all story content. Please be considerate when discussing characters, dungeons, and zones from the current expansion. If you're unsure whether something is a spoiler, use `||spoiler tags||`.

## 🧩 Respect puzzle mysteries

Jump puzzles often include elements of mystery and exploration. To preserve the challenge for others, use `||spoiler tags||` when discussing puzzle solutions in ⁠[🕵puzzle-solving-help](https://discord.com/channels/405231159488937984/996483560305332384).

## ⭐ Understand the ratings system

The star system provides a general difficulty guideline, not a definitive measure of individual experience. Ratings are based on a comprehensive evaluation and may be adjusted upon review. Remember, lower ratings don't indicate lower quality builds.

## 👷 Appreciate puzzle builders' efforts

Puzzle creation involves significant effort and creative use of the housing system. If you encounter issues that seem unintentional, you can inquire about them in ⁠⁠[🕵puzzle-solving-help](https://discord.com/channels/405231159488937984/996483560305332384). Please understand that not all issues can be resolved due to system limitations.

## 📹 Request permission for streaming or recording

Some builders have preferences regarding the sharing of their puzzles. Please ask for permission before streaming or recording puzzle content.

## 🛠️ TPP use and discussion

We acknowledge that some players use TPP. While its use is allowed, please be mindful of potential risks, especially with outdoor builds. We kindly ask that TPP files not be shared in in-game public channels.

## 🔞 Keep content family-friendly

As some members browse this server at work, please refrain from posting explicit, obscene, or graphic content. This applies to all forms of media shared here.

## 🔒 Protect your privacy

We encourage maintaining a level of privacy that separates your online persona from your personal life. Be cautious about sharing specific personal information.

## 🔗 Exercise caution with links

To protect your account and personal information, be wary of clicking links in direct messages. We recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your Discord and Square-Enix accounts.

## 🤐 Handle personal conflicts privately

While we understand that disagreements may occur, we ask that personal conflicts be resolved outside of the server. Our focus is on maintaining a welcoming environment for all members and preserving puzzle data.

## 🏷️ For builders: Thoughtful puzzle naming

When naming your puzzles, please be considerate if referencing other players. Obtain consent before using others' names or likenesses in your puzzle titles.
