# Welcome to Parkour League!

The premise is simple: we provide a list of puzzles, you clear them! Once you clear every puzzle in a circuit, you gain a badge! Each circuit will consist of puzzles of the same difficulty level from the same region, e.g. NA 1★ Circuit, EU 2★ Circuit, etc. Badges and roles will be awarded with completions.

## So what's the point of collecting every circuit badge from a region?

- Your badge will be upgraded to role.
- Going back to do the easier puzzles will be a good way to make friends or introduce new jumpers to parkour.
- We highly encourage you to ping the Social Jumper role on discord and/or post PFs and try to have fun with it!

_(You will be awarded with a permanent version of your highest badge per region once the League Season comes to a close; 4★ badge counts for both regions)_

## Rules

We're not going to go hard on rules because Parkour League is meant to be a fun and social thing and not really something we want to police or validate. We'll be going by the honor system with badges (they're just for fun anyways) and we ask that you use new clears even if you have already cleared a puzzle before. Some of the puzzles selected for the League might be older builds you haven't seen in a while anyways.

Also, puzzles from Empyreum and Shirogane may be difficult to access if you've created alts in a new region. You can try to ask for friend teleports in <#845500181385707560> but if you are unable to get one they aren't required for badges from alt regions.

So tl;dr: using honor system, post new clears only, Empyreum and Shirogane puzzles not required for alt region badges

## Badge Claim

React to the corresponding letter when you clear that puzzle, post your clear pics in the badge claim channel, and ping a mod when you're ready to claim your circuit badge. If you're unsure of what you're trying to claim, just let an admin know that you cleared all puzzles in a circuit so we can check your reacts to the circuit list and give out the badge.

## Parkour League Archive

Where you can revisit previous seasons if you missed out or want to revisit puzzle collections you weren't able to complete. These lists will update automatically from our database, so address changes and closures will be reflected.
