# Jump Puzzle Glossary

## BLU Cheese 🧀

- Using Self-Destruct to skip segments of a puzzle with the assistance of an ally with resurrection. Frowned upon by most builders.

## Bodybangers 🎢

- Requiring challengers to land on specific sides of platforms or launch from specific sides due to midair obstacles or obstructions.

## Bonus Stage 🎉

- Adding a segment or an additional challenge to a Jump Puzzle after the Message Book and / or Goal Endpoint.

## Builder's Advantage 🛠️

- From making and testing a puzzle, the builder may have a significant advantage, or underestimate the challenges when running a course compared to regular jumpers. Can also be passed to other people if they watch you build your puzzle or help test it.

## Bullet Lift 🚀

- To catch the lifting properties of some furnishings near the ground, it may be necessary to rapid-tap the movement key and jump key together. Seen with Dress Forms and some housing skins.

## Camera Obstruction 📷

- Using windows to compromise the camera of the challenger to raise difficulty.

## Ceiling Lift / Elevator ⬆️

- Using furnishings near the roof to jump into the void, usually Star Globes or Dragon Lamps but several other options exist. This is commonly used to enter puzzles.

## Checkpoints ✅

- By either dividing up a housing instance with Void Intrusions or setting up raised flooring, it's possible to allow challengers to make progress in Jump Puzzles and proceed without losing all progress on a fall.

## Cloud Puzzle ☁️

- A Jump Puzzle mostly made out of disjointed furnishings floating away from each other in the middle of the void space, like moisture in a rain cloud. It is resistant to all types of Phasing or Void Jumps.

## Corner Grab 🔄

- Sometimes, it's possible to jump around a weak corner or Bodybanger and swerve onto a landing surface on the other side without falling.

## Cube Lift 📦

- Using the entire cube as a lift to reach other furnishings in the Jump Puzzle in an otherwise impossible manner. Commonly seen in the Goblet.

## Doze Gate 🛏️

- Using the /Doze command to teleport to a nearby bed. This can cause you to go through walls, floors or ceilings. This is a common puzzle entrance.

## Emote 🎭

- Subtype (E) - The puzzle has points where /sit or /doze interactions with furnishings are required to cross gaps or walls; these points can be hidden. (E+) indicates that emotes will trigger furniture movement ("slides"), potentially locking you out and forcing a re-entry to reset.

## Expedient ⚡

- Available from 90 Scholar. Increases movement speed of self and nearby party members by 30%. Useful for puzzles where Sprint isn't cutting it alone.

## Fake Platforms ❌

- Intentionally using furnishings with no collision to mislead and possibly reset the progress of challengers.

## Forbidden Phasing 🚷

- By walking into a wall while centered and jumping before phasing kicks in after about 2 paces (typically), you can phase through some furnishings without phasing through all of them.

## FPS Manipulation 🎮

- It's possible to make some precision jumps in Jump Puzzles easier by lowering/raising FPS, but most puzzles below the God level will have other ways to reliably manage difficult jumps.

## Furniture Hitboxes 📏

- Using the hitboxes of certain furnishings to create obstacles that knock challengers down or cause them to slip off, often raises difficulty.

## Ghost 👻

- Subtype (G) - Also called Ghosting, the puzzle has furnishings that disappear and reset in a predetermined order depending on character position. (G+) has multiple stages of Ghosting that will disappear and reset in predetermined orders.

## Ghost Lift 🎈

- also called heavy lifting, or sometimes just referred to as an upwarp. An extended lift can be created by furnishings interacting vertically even without a physical connection.

## Goal 🎯

- An additional objective set on a puzzle address, often asking challengers to avoid using certain techs or to follow other special rules. A Goal will also be applied if a Jump Puzzle's Message Book is not at the finish line.

## Goblet Shell 🏺

- In Goblet houses and rooms, the outside rim of the housing cube can be walked on. This can become a mechanic in certain puzzles. Applies to the pillars in other housing zones except for the Mist.

## Headbangers 🤕

- Using higher furnishings to knock challengers down based on how they jump.

## Henteko Blockade 🚧

- This involves floating solid furnishings above a floor just high enough to prevent Phasing but low enough to still block progress. Not always impossible to phase through.

## High Precision 🎯

- Requiring exact angles and momentums to make certain jumps, usually raises difficulty significantly.

## Invisible Wall Pegs 🧱

- Placing furnishings behind a wall in such a way that the edges can be landed on but can't be seen.

## Job Gate 🎮

- Subtype (J) - The puzzle has gaps that can only be crossed using specific job abilities, i.e. En Avant, Elusive Jump, Aetherial Manipulation, Hell's Ingress/Egress, etc. (J+) requires a specific job such as Blue Mage for Co-op puzzles, or when only certain job abilities will navigate gaps.

## Jump Fatigue 😩

- The term for someone getting exhausted in a Jump Puzzle. Easy to trigger with higher precision and difficulty. Relieved by taking a short break and/or returning another day.

## Koi Jump 🐟

- Turning off a Speed Boost during a Leap of Faith in order to make sure you don't overshoot the jump. Does not exist in a puzzle and is likely an impossible theory.

## Leap of Faith 🏃‍♂️

- The challenger must make a huge downward jump to land on a distant platform, often small. Raises difficulty.

## Logic 🧩

- Subtype (L) - The puzzle employs Ghosting and Slides in unconventional ways that redefine what a jump puzzle truly is; can be viewed as a modifier for the other tags. (L+) requires deep understanding of techniques that may be used together to create significant obstacles to solve.

## Moon Flute 🎶

- Available from Blue Mage after learning 10 spells. Increases movement speed by 30%. Useful for puzzles where Sprint isn't cutting it alone.

## Mystery 🕵️‍♂️

- Subtype (M) - The puzzle that has hard-to-find or maze-like paths, furniture combinations with hard-to-solve interactions; tricky, misleading, or deceptive elements. (M+) can signify Mystery complex enough to greatly affect the difficulty rating.

## Ninja Jump 🥷

- Jumping from a Ninja Wall or combination for furniture that does not allow you to build up any speed before you jump off of it.

## Ninja Passive Speed ⚡

- Increases speed by 10% at all times. Jump Puzzles are usually not balanced around this, but may make some jumps smoother when faster speed isn't in use.

## Ninja Walls 🧱

- By using the lower lining of certain partitions like Glade Partitions, you can create narrow surfaces to walk and jump on.

## No Media 🚫

- Subtype (X) - The puzzle is subject to a no streaming/recording request from the builder. Some builders prefer to keep a low profile or keep their puzzles mysterious, please respect their wishes!

## Obscure Entrance 🔍

- A sometimes very hard to find entrance to a puzzle. It may include hidden Doze Gates / Upwarps, or require you to do a series of steps before you are able to reach the entrance.

## Partition Transfer 🔄

- Moving from one side of the lip of a Ninja Wall partition suspended in the air to the other by going around the corners without the help of any nearby furnishings. The difficulty of this technique varies widely depending on what kind of method the challenger uses and how much they have practiced it.

## Peloton 🚴‍♂️

- Available to Ranged DPS at Level 20. Increases movement speed by 20%. Extremely valuable to have in several Jump Puzzles. The Golden Standard of speed boosts, this allows jumpers to consistently jump further without a cooldown.

## Phase Pad 🛋️

- By balancing on top of the hitboxes of multiple items like Il Mheg Lamps or Bomb Cauldrons, it's possible to trigger a special jump. Run in place for a few paces, then jump in any direction before Phasing kicks in and drops you. Nearby furnishings may be Phased by this action. This technique is considered to be different from the Forbidden Technique.

## Phasing 🌌

- Subtype (P) - The puzzle uses furnishings you need to run straight into until they let you pass through them; Phasing is often banned so check puzzle rules! (P+) requires Jump Phasing ("Forbidden Tech") to prevent phasing through what you're standing on.

## Pipe Phasing 🚰

- Some furnishings like Industrial Wall Pipes have an unreasonably long Phase range and will stay Phased until moving an extreme distance away (Between 8y-15y). If you can sit in a chair, you're far enough away. Phasing elsewhere or using room lifts may also fix it. Notably, this can be used to Phase out pipes near other objects by Phasing out the other objects.

## Pumps 🔄

- When multiple wall items with snapping intersect and anchor to other surfaces, it's possible to make complicated Slide Mechanisms that loop. Notated by (E+).

## PvP Door 🚪

- A door partition that requires Phasing to land on top of the door, but is disabled when the door opens. Becomes problematic when a large number of challengers are present. WARNING: People can grief with this and "lock" a course with it, so we suggest not using this below the 5 Star level.

## Return Dash 🔙

- After falling from a great height and sticking, it is sometimes possible to use a Job Dash like those used in Job Gates to return to the point where the challenger fell in a puzzle. This technique is unreliable and should not be depended on.

## Semi-Solid Void Barrier 🌌

- Using an extremely thin slice of Void Wall to produce the conditions necessary for Void Jumps. Becomes more solid at high FPS and less solid at low FPS.

## Sit / Doze Jump 🛋️

- Utilizing the /sit or /doze command to sit on some chairs or beds near a moderately high wall, it's possible to scale the distance and land on top of the wall or other furnishing when a jump would normally fail. Difficult to construct.

## Sit Gate 🚪

- Have to use the /sit command to teleport slightly upward and/or sideways to proceed to a chair or chair-like object.

## Slides / Locks 🔒

- By sitting, dozing, resetting to the front door, or ressing, certain furnishings jammed through other furnishings may suddenly change their position temporarily for only that person. Usually involves multiple partitions and wall-mounted items.

## Speed ⚡

- Subtype (S) - The puzzle makes you wait on Sprint cooldown due to early or multiple long jumps, only applies when jumps are near/beyond max Peloton range. Combat this by bringing extra speed buffs such as Expedient (Scholar) or Moon Flute (Blue Mage).

## Sprint 🏃‍♂️

- Increases speed by 30% for 20 seconds with a 1 minute cooldown. Necessary in many Jump Puzzles.

## Staggered Lift ⬆️

- Also called a Moving Upwarp, to use some nearby lifts, it may be necessary to jump sideways into them to either immediately make them work or produce sticking to then make them work with a jump.

## Staggered Phase Lift ⬆️

- By Phasing through or using Forbidden Phasing on some furnishings, you can stick into the bottom of them and then use them as lifts. This is most often relevant in God Puzzles.

## Structure Puzzle 🏗️

- A Jump Puzzle where many of the furnishings are touching and visually form a structure, with less furnishings just floating alone in the air. These tend to look more realistic and some furnishings may be used multiple times, but Structure Puzzles tend to have vulnerabilities to the Forbidden Technique, Phasing, and / or Void Jumps.

## Subtypes 🏷️

- Also known as tags, these are descriptions about a puzzle and what techniques are required to clear them.

## Upwarp ⬆️

- Jumping up underneath certain furniture may cause you to get suctioned up to the next available standable surface.

## Void Jump 🌌

- Subtype (V) - The puzzle has vertical gaps that can only be crossed using a void jump and are required to complete the puzzle. A void jump is performed by running straight over the void for 3 seconds before jumping underneath your desired landing.

## Void Wall 🚧

- An impassible, invisible wall created by the void that is outside the edges of the housing cube.

## Warping 🔄

- A phenomenon where a challenger is teleported down to a lower surface, usually while walking off the edge of a platform. Happens at the edges of the housing cube or outside of the housing cube when gaps exist in flooring.
