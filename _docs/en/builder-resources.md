# Builder Resources and Handy Links

## **Void Building Catalogue**:

From Fox and Nae Whitearrow

This is a catalogue of every housing item that pulls information from Fox's Furniture List. Each item is searchable by specific properties like if an item has collision or not, they all have pictures so you can see what you want at a glance, and you can combine search tags to find just the right item for your building needs.

## **Ghosting calculator**:

From Haise

This is a handy tool that will make building ghost puzzles even easier as it calculates where the trigger needs to be on the other side of the void sphere.

This will calculate coordinates along the surface within a 50-yalm radius of the housing sphere for the ghosting technique. Yellow arrow is north.

**Steps**

- Drag the sphere to your desired position or enter a coordinate and click validate to snap to the closest point on the surface to that position.
- Enter the whole digit in BDTH. Rounding will give invalid coordinates/distances. The UI on BDTH will round the number but the value will be set.
